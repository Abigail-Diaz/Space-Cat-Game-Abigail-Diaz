## Program Description

My project is a platform game where a cat must pass the level wihout loosing all lives. 
The cat must jump and move forward while avoiding obstacles and enemies.
The goal of the program is to provide a simple game that works smoothly with the player's input and
without errors that would ruin the gaming experience. The program will let the user know if they
have lost the game or not.

## Software Engineering

Describe the software engineering techniques used for the design and development of this program.

The software engeneering techniques from the Software Development Life Cycle (SDLC) that have been used in the development of the project are checking if the project is feasible. The feasability taken into account is technical, since it would affect the project's progress the most when it comes to proper knowledge for implementation. The second important feasibility is time since the project must be finished within 8 weeks. 

## Testing Script

Describe the testing process using paragraphs and numbered bullet lists how to manually test the software here.
